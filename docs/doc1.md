# Media Collection Manager — Project Progress Update

## 🔄 Project Direction Update

The project has been **revamped** into a **Book/Media Collection Manager**.  
This decision was made to better align with the goals of creating a full-stack application that is both practical and user-focused.

### ✅ Key Features Planned:
- Add and manage books/movies you've watched or plan to watch
- Mark items as read/watched
- Filter/search through collection

This structure opens up a lot of possibilities for both a rich user interface and real-world backend logic.

---

## 📦 Frontend

A **new React frontend** has been created from scratch under the `media-collection-frontend` directory.

### Current Focus:
- Building UI components and layout
- Structuring reusable elements and views
- Making the app interactive with mock/local data for now

This phase will primarily involve frontend development while waiting for the backend to be implemented.

---

## 🛠️ Backend

Backend development will begin soon. The priority is to:

- Set up a proper database connection
- Create endpoints for media CRUD operations
- Work on filtering/search logic via API

---

## 🔀 Branch Strategy

A simplified git workflow will be used this time:

- `main`: Stable production-ready code
- `frontend`: All React development and UI work
- `backend`: All backend logic and integration

*Note:* We're avoiding too many branches as seen in the last project. Clear division between frontend and backend branches should be enough for now.

**Keep commits clean, branches clear, and updates frequent! 🚀**
