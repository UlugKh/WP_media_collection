# Project Updates

## ✅ Great Progress

- **Backend**: DTOs are almost fully ready.
- **Frontend Dev**: Partly connected the frontend to the backend.
- **UI/UX Designer**: Currently working on the design and overall look of the frontend.
- **User Authentication**: Basic user authentication system has been implemented.

## ⚠️ Weak Points

- Some parts of the code are new and undocumented.  
  → I issued a request to document these areas to make them more intuitive.
  
- **Login flow issue**:  
  → Currently, the user login is forced as the first endpoint.  
  → Our system model allows login to be optional.  
  → I’ve communicated this to the team and it should be fixed soon.

- **Frontend Design Delay**:  
  → Frontend design is taking too long.  
  → I’ve been regularly reminding the frontend developer to speed it up.

- **React Frontend Issues**:  
  - Buttons labeled **"HOME"** and **"ADD MEDIA"** are misnamed or misused.  
  - Functionality is present, but opening **ADD MEDIA** takes forever to load the media list — sometimes it doesn’t load at all.  
  → These issues have been communicated to the frontend developer.

- **Team Collaboration**:  
  - Second backend developer hasn’t committed anything yet.  
  → Considering assigning them to help with the frontend or UI/UX tasks.
