# 📚 My Backend Overview

Hey team! 👋  
Here's a quick breakdown of how the backend is structured and how everything works behind the scenes. I kept it simple and to-the-point so it's easy to understand and refer back to. Let’s dive in! 🚀

---

## 🧱 Overall Structure

We’re working with **5 main collections** in our MongoDB database:

- 📘 `Books`
- 🎬 `Movies`
- 📺 `Shows`
- 📖 `Mangas`
- 🌸 `Animes`

Each collection has **3 layers** of classes tied to it:

1. **Repository**
2. **Service**
3. **Controller**

---

## 🔍 Repository Layer

💡 This layer is where we connect to MongoDB.  
Each repository interface extends `MongoRepository` (or a similar MongoDB interface depending on the setup).

👉 It allows us to use all the built-in MongoDB commands like:

- `findAll()`
- `findById(id)`
- `save()`
- `deleteById(id)`

Think of this layer as the direct line to the database.

---

## 🛠️ Service Layer

This is where things get customized! 🔧  
The service class acts like a middleman between the controller and the database logic.

✨ Here’s what I usually do in services:

- Filter or sort results
- Add extra logic on top of database queries
- Handle potential errors or edge cases
- Customize data flow

So if you want to tweak how something is fetched or processed before it gets sent to the client — this is the place.

---

## 🌐 Controller Layer

This is the entry point of our API 📡  
The controller handles all the HTTP requests and responses (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

Here’s what the controller does:

- Calls the right method from the service
- Wraps the response into a `ResponseEntity<>`
- Maps endpoints with annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

📌 This is also where we handle things like:
- Query params
- Path variables
- Status codes

---

## 🧾 Example Flow (for `Books`)

Let’s say the client wants a list of all books:

1. 🔁 **Controller** receives a GET request to `/books`
2. 💬 It calls the `getAllBooks()` method from the **Service**
3. 🧠 Service does any custom processing (if needed), then calls `findAll()` from the **Repository**
4. 📤 Data is returned back up to the **Controller**, which wraps it in a `ResponseEntity<List<Book>>`
5. 🚚 The final result is sent to the client!

---

## ✅ Summary

So to keep it simple:

- **Repository** = raw MongoDB access 🗃️
- **Service** = custom business logic 🛠️
- **Controller** = API response control + routing 🌐

If you’re ever unsure where to put a piece of logic:
- **If it talks directly to the database** → Repository
- **If it adds logic or filters data** → Service
- **If it’s about handling requests or responses** → Controller

Hope that helps! Let me know if anything's unclear 😄
